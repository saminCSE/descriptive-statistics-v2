## Descriptive Statistics Assignment - Nasogastric Tube Malposition Study

---

**[INTRODUCTION - 30 seconds]**

Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone. Today, I'll be presenting my analysis on the potential risk of nasogastric tube malposition using the traditional Nose-Ear-Xiphoid measurement method. This study is particularly important in clinical practice as proper nasogastric tube placement is crucial for patient safety and effective treatment.

**[BACKGROUND & PURPOSE - 30 seconds]**

Nasogastric tubes are commonly used in medical settings for feeding and medication administration. The traditional NEX measurement—measuring from the nose, to the ear, to the xiphoid process—is the standard method to determine insertion depth. However, the accuracy of this method has been questioned. This study investigates whether certain anatomical measurements can predict the risk of tube malposition, specifically comparing patients with proper placement versus those experiencing side-hole passage issues.

**[METHODOLOGY & DATA - 20 seconds]**

The research analyzed various anatomical measurements including:

- Age and height demographics
- NG length (nose to gastric distance)
- EX length (ear to xiphoid distance)
- NEX length (nose-ear-xiphoid distance)
- And several other anatomical markers

Patients were divided into two groups: those with no side-hole passage and those with at least one side-hole passage during tube insertion.

**[KEY FINDINGS - 60 seconds]**

Looking at Table 1, the descriptive statistics reveal some fascinating results. The study examined 8 different variables, and three showed statistically significant differences:

**First**, the NG length showed a p-value of 0.003—highly significant. The "No side-hole pass" group had an average NG length of 488.6 millimeters, which was notably longer than the 458.4 millimeters in the side-hole pass group. This 30-millimeter difference is clinically meaningful.

**Second**, the EX length had a p-value of 0.020. Here, the pattern reversed—the no-side-hole group measured shorter at 348.1 millimeters compared to 368.9 millimeters in the other group.

**Third**, the NEX length was also significant with a p-value of 0.036. The no-side-hole group measured 500 millimeters versus 523 millimeters in the side-hole group.

Interestingly, age, height, and the other anatomical measurements showed no significant differences, with p-values well above 0.05.

The visualization in Figure 1 clearly illustrates these differences, with the starred variables showing the significant separations between the two groups.

**[IMPLICATIONS - 30 seconds]**

These findings have important clinical implications. The significant variations suggest that the traditional one-size-fits-all NEX measurement approach may not be adequate for all patients. Individual anatomical characteristics—particularly the relationship between nose-to-gastric distance and ear-to-xiphoid measurements—should be considered when determining optimal insertion depth. Patients with certain proportional differences may be at higher risk for malposition.

**[CONCLUSION - 10 seconds]**

In conclusion, this descriptive statistical analysis demonstrates that anatomical variations do matter in nasogastric tube placement. A more personalized approach considering these measurements could improve placement accuracy and patient safety.

Thank you for your attention. I'm happy to answer any questions.
